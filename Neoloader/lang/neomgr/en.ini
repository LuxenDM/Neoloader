44=If you are having issues with Neoloader, try uninstalling it. This button will remove as much neoloader-based data as possible from your config.ini, and will prevent it from automatically loading until you are able to remove the plugin's files from your game. You might also want to do this if you are upgrading to a new version of Neoloader. If you want to install Neoloader again, use the button that will appear in your Options menu to trigger the setup process.
